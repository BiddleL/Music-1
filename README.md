Cloudation is a music visualizer, mostly suited for trap tracks, made to resemble the awesome visualization of the Trapnation YouTube channel.

Cloudation has been made using canvas and WebAudio, it fetches the music tracks using the SoundCloud API and the backgrounds using the Unsplash API.

You can paste a SoundCloud url in the field, drag'n'drop a .ogg or .mp3 file in the page or drag'n'drop a SoundCloud url (easter egg ;) ).

You can also stick a # with the SoundCloud track url at the end of the visualizer and share the url with your friends like [that](https://stelabouras.github.io/cloudnation/#https://soundcloud.com/alltrapnation/5-am)!
